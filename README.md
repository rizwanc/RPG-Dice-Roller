# RPG-Dice-Roller
A dice rolling app for table top role playing games

This is a dice rolling app for Android! You choose the dice you want to use from
a drop down list and then click the roll button! Your roll will be displayed in 
the middle of the screen.

I will be making updates to the app and adding new features. Some features include
the ability to roll multiple dice, adding modifiers, and displaying the individual
rolls beneath the main roll so the user knows the breakdown of what was rolled.
Stay tuned for more!
